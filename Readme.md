# Taffy Documentation

This repo is the source of the [documentation](http://docs.taffy.io) for [Taffy](http://taffy.io).

To submit changes for the docs site, fork this repo and send a pull request. If you want to edit something in [the wiki](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/_pages) then file a bug or [contact me directly](http://fusiongrokker.com/page/contact-me). One day I hope to have everything migrated out of the wiki.

The files you need to edit are markdown files in the `src` folder, named after their affected version. If your change is not applicable until the next release (e.g. only available in the `master` branch of [Taffy](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/)) then you'll need to create a new file (by copying the latest version's file and modifying it as appropriate). Please ask what to name the new file, as there are always a few different options for the next version number.

Thanks for your contributions!
